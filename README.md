# Arc AI agent 1.0

# Overview
AI agent 1.0 minimized the closed loop for creating virtual characters and their interactions through voice and expressions. Four preset virtual characters and a voice library, along with a visual representation of conversation history functions are provided.  
- **Create avatars**  
  Users can customize and create their own avatars. To help achieve this, our project provides four preset characters with different personalities and speaking styles.
    - ***In-car assistant***: An assistant focused on providing information and solving problems.  
    - ***Emotional companion***: An emotionally supportive presence that engages users in comforting conversations.  
    - ***Guide***: A character that provides insights and suggestions about places of interest during the trip.  
    - ***Language teacher***: An educational character that helps users learn and practice new languages.  
- **UI expression mapping**  
We introduced a set of UI expressions corresponding to the content of the conversation, enhancing visual interaction and providing users with a more expressive interface.  
- **Voice switching**  
A voice library is provided, and users can choose different voice tones for the avatar to enhance the personality and charm of the avatar.  
- **Visual interface for conversation history**  
A user-friendly interface displays conversation records, allowing users to easily review their interactions.  
- **Local music playback**  
Users can play local music files to add entertainment to the overall experience.
