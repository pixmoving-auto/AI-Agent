<h1>Arc AI agent 1.0</h1>

Overview
------

AI agent 1.0 minimized the closed loop for creating virtual characters and their interactions through voice and expressions. Four preset virtual characters and a voice library, along with a visual representation of conversation history functions are provided.

### **Create avatars**
Users can customize and create their own avatars. To help achieve this, our project provides four preset characters with different personalities and speaking styles:
- **In-car assistant**: An assistant focused on providing information and solving problems.
- **Emotional companion**: An emotionally supportive presence that engages users in comforting conversations.
- **Guide**: A character that provides insights and suggestions about places of interest during the trip.
- **Language teacher**: An educational character that helps users learn and practice new languages.

### **Voice switching**
A voice library is provided, and users can choose different voice tones for the avatar to enhance the personality and charm of the avatar.

### **UI expression mapping**
We introduced a set of UI expressions corresponding to the content of the conversation, enhancing visual interaction and providing users with a more expressive interface.

### **Visual interface for conversation history**
A user-friendly interface displays conversation records, allowing users to easily review their interactions.

### **Local music playback**
Users can play local music files to add entertainment to the overall experience.
